# TaskManager
### Description
The system was created to manage tasks on a project
Basic user roles:
1. Manager. The manager can:
  * Manage tasks (create, delete, edit, assign workers to them).
  * Manage users (register new users, edit their information, assign roles to them).
  * Manage workspaces (create workspaces, add other workers to them).
2. An employee is a generalized concept for different roles (front-end, back-end, tester, and so on). They have the same functionality in the system. Can view tasks in available workspaces. In their profile, they see the task assigned to them and also receive notifications (for example, when they are added to a workspace or when they are assigned a task). They can notify the author of the task about its completion.
